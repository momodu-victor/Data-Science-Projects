Forecasted the out-of-state total cost and proffered key insights and strategies to improve planning and budgeting for prospective students.

Most prospective students and their respective guardians oftern have questions that revolve around the following:

- How much will it cost?

- How much do we save?

These are the most critical challenges in higher education planning.

According to The College Board’s Trends in College Pricing 2018, the average annual cost of out-state tuition, fees, room, and board at a four-year public institution is $25,370 for the academic year 2018–2019. For a private institution, the cost of tuition, fees, room, and board is $ 48,510. Both public and private colleges and universities experienced an increase of nearly 3% (2.8% for public and 3.2% for private) from the prior year, 2017–2018. Although the average tuition increase at private four-year schools is 3.3%, many students in this sector attend institutions with tuition increases of between 3% and 6%.If the cost of a college education increases by 6% annually, and your child enters a private college in the 2035–2036 academic year, the estimated tuition could be $57,544.

For young families, skyrocketing cost projections can lead to sticker shock, but there are strategies that can help you keep pace with tuition hikes

This project would help estimate the approximate annual out_of_state_total cost for a two or four-year undergraduate education for either a choice for public or private institution.

Hence, using the US education data, we are offering a solution by predicting the out-of-state total cost for public and private universities and colleges.

This would facilitate data-driven decision making for the prospective student and improve planning and budgeting.
